# Competitive Analysis - n8n MCP Servers

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-04
**Analyzed By**: Claude
**Purpose**: Identify gaps and opportunities to make this the BEST n8n MCP server

## Executive Summary

There are currently **2 major n8n MCP server implementations**:

1. **leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server** - Focused on n8n API workflow management
2. **czlonkowski/n8n-mcp** (THIS PROJECT) - Focused on node documentation + API management

**Key Finding**: These projects are **complementary**, not competing. The leonardsellem implementation focuses purely on API operations, while our implementation combines documentation access WITH API management.
