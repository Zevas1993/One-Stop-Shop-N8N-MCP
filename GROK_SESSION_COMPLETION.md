## Architectural Decisions Documented

### Decision 1: Communication Protocol
**Selected:** stdio with JSON-RPC
**Rationale:** Simplest, works in all environments, better process lifecycle
**Trade-off:** Large payloads require streaming (mitigated)

### Decision 2: Model Selection
**Selected:** Hardware-aware auto-detection
**Rationale:** Works on 4GB to 32GB hardware, no configuration needed
**Models:** 3-tier system (4GB/8GB/16GB+)

### Decision 3: LLM Inference
**Selected:** llama.cpp
**Rationale:** Single-binary deployment, good CPU performance, GPU support
**Trade-off:** Less abstraction than Ollama

### Decision 4: Caching Strategy
**Selected:** Dual-layer (L1 memory + L2 SQLite)
**Rationale:** 90%+ cache hit rate, no Redis dependency, survives restart
**Targets:** <50ms total query latency

### Decision 5: Process Management
**Selected:** Supervisord in Docker
**Rationale:** Manages 4 services, auto-restart, simple debugging
**Services:** API, UI, Tools, Python

### Decision 6: Multi-User Isolation
**Selected:** Per-user Docker volumes
**Rationale:** Single container (cost), separate volumes (security), shared models (efficient)
**Structure:** Shared `/models/` + per-user `/user_state/{id}/`

### Decision 7: Docker Optimization
**Selected:** Runtime-only dependencies
**Rationale:** 82% smaller images, 10x faster builds, pre-built database
**Dependencies:** 5 packages (MCP SDK, SQLite, Express, etc.)

### Decision 8: Version Tracking
**Selected:** Daemon process with polling
**Rationale:** Automatic, works without webhooks, configurable frequency
**Workflow:** Check ‚Üí Compare ‚Üí Rebuild ‚Üí Log

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Python-TypeScript Communication Latency
**Mitigation:** Proven stdio protocol, <10ms target, request batching
**Backup:** Fallback to keyword search

### Risk 2: Hardware Constraints (4GB Raspberry Pi)
**Mitigation:** Hardware-aware models, tested on 4GB, degradation mode
**Backup:** Keyword-search-only fallback

### Risk 3: Multi-User Data Isolation
**Mitigation:** Per-user volumes, strict access controls, extensive testing
**Backup:** Separate containers per user (less efficient)

### Risk 4: Automatic Updates Breaking Changes
**Mitigation:** Version tracking, staged rollouts, database backup
**Backup:** Manual rollback capability

### Risk 5: Docker Build Failures
**Mitigation:** Multi-stage build with checkpoints, testing
**Backup:** Pre-built base images

### Risk 6: Supervisord Process Crashes
**Mitigation:** Auto-restart, health checks, monitoring
**Backup:** Manual docker restart

### Risk 7: Performance Under Load
**Mitigation:** Load testing, cache optimization, performance targets
**Backup:** Request queuing, rate limiting

### Risk 8: Security Vulnerabilities
**Mitigation:** Security scanning, minimal dependencies, SBOM generation
**Backup:** Rapid security patching process

## Lessons & Insights

### Lesson 1: Gap Analysis is Essential
The initial 8-15 day estimate didn't account for 173 gaps. Comprehensive analysis revealed the need for a 5-day planning phase.

### Lesson 2: Phase -1 is Non-Negotiable
13 CRITICAL gaps cannot be resolved during implementation. A planning phase prevents 10-20 days of rework.

### Lesson 3: Complementary, Not Competing
The two Grok proposals are perfectly complementary: Proposal #1 provides infrastructure, Proposal #2 adds operational capabilities.

### Lesson 4: Hardware Awareness Requires Upfront Design
Supporting 4GB to 32GB hardware with appropriate models requires detailed planning of hardware tiers and model selection.

### Lesson 5: Multi-User Isolation Must Be Designed
Adding multi-user support after initial implementation is expensive. Designing for it upfront ensures correctness.

### Lesson 6: Clear Specifications Enable Parallel Work
Phases 5.4 and 5.5 can run in parallel after Phase -1, reducing total timeline from sequential execution.
