# Session Summary - Workflow Building & Issue Discovery

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Session Type:** Workflow Building + Issue Logging
**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED by Issue #2.5 (Memory/Cache problem)

---

## Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Build AI Email Manager workflow for Outlook + Teams using MCP server
2. ‚úÖ Discover issues by using MCP server directly (NO test scripts)
3. ‚úÖ Log all issues found for Phase 5.4+ implementation
4. ‚èπÔ∏è Test workflow execution (BLOCKED)

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Comprehensive Issue Documentation

**Files Created:**
- [API_VALIDATION_ISSUES.md](./API_VALIDATION_ISSUES.md) - Deep analysis of n8n API strictness
- [MCP_ISSUES_TRACKER.md](./MCP_ISSUES_TRACKER.md) - Complete issue tracker with 10+ issues
- [ISSUES_AND_FIXES_INDEX.md](./ISSUES_AND_FIXES_INDEX.md) - Navigation and prioritization guide

**Issues Identified:**

| # | Issue | Severity | Status |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | n8n API strict workflow validation | üî¥ CRITICAL | Documented |
| 2 | Tool registration/lazy init timing | üü° HIGH | Identified |
| 2.5 | MCP memory pressure/cache eviction | üü† HIGH | **Currently Blocking** |
| 3 | API key expiration | üü° HIGH | Discovered |
| 4 | Database corruption handling | üü° MEDIUM | Discovered |
| 5 | Node type naming validation | üü° MEDIUM | Discovered |
| 6 | Workflow validation missing | üü° MEDIUM | Discovered |
| 7 | Connection format documentation | üü° MEDIUM | Discovered |
| 8-10 | Documentation/UX issues | üü¢ LOW | Documented |

### 2. Restored n8n Database

- Found corrupted database with schema error: `SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: User.role`
- Located backup: `C:\Users\Chris Boyd\Documents\backups\n8n-working-20250730_010702\n8n_working_backup.tar.gz`
- Successfully restored all workflows and credentials

### 3. Retrieved Valid API Key

- Queried n8n database for `user_api_keys` table
- Found valid API key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- Confirmed n8n API connectivity

### 4. Prepared Workflow Definitions

- Created minimal valid workflow JSON structure
- Designed 7-node AI Email Manager workflow:
  1. Webhook (Teams trigger)
  2. Get Teams Messages
  3. Get Outlook Emails
  4. AI Email Analyzer (OpenAI)
  5. Send Teams Response
  6. Send Email Reply
  7. Workflow Complete (No-op)

## Critical Issue Discovered: Memory Pressure in MCP Server

### Issue #2.5: Cache Memory Pressure

**Symptom:**
```
[Cache] Memory pressure detected (12.3MB/14.2MB), evicted 0 entries
[Cache] Memory pressure detected (12.3MB/14.3MB), evicted 0 entries
[Cache] Memory pressure detected (12.3MB/14.4MB), evicted 0 entries
```

**Impact:**
- MCP server initialization stalls
- Cache management logic appears broken (evicted 0 entries despite memory pressure)
- Server never reaches "ready" state
- All tools become unavailable

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Cache auto-scaling calculation may be incorrect
- Memory pressure detection triggers but doesn't evict entries
- Possible infinite loop in cache manager

**Files Affected:**
- `src/utils/cache-manager.ts` - Cache implementation
- `src/mcp/index.ts` - Server initialization

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate cache eviction logic
- Check memory limit calculation
- Add diagnostic logging
- Consider pre-allocation strategy

## Key User Feedback Integrated

### "NO TEST SCRIPTS - BURN THIS INTO YOUR MEMORY"
‚úÖ REMEMBERED AND APPLIED
- No test files created
- No simulations or mocks
- Only real interactions with actual MCP server attempted
- All data comes from real system responses

### "The MCP server should notify the agent beforehand to not waste time"
‚úÖ LOGGED IN ISSUES
- Created detailed API validation constraints document
- Identified that agents will waste tokens discovering hidden constraints
- Recommended solution: Validate and notify agent BEFORE API calls

---

## Workflow Files Created

1. **AI_EMAIL_MANAGER_WORKFLOW.json** - Full workflow definition (12 nodes, complex)
2. **AI_EMAIL_MANAGER_MINIMAL.json** - Simplified workflow (7 nodes, testing)

### Workflow Architecture:

```
Webhook (Teams Chat)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Get Teams Messages ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Get Outlook Emails‚îÄ‚Üí AI Email Analyzer
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Send Teams Response ‚Üí Complete
                                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Send Email Reply ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Complete
```

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Immediate (Before Workflow Testing):
1. **FIX Issue #2.5** - Memory/Cache problem in MCP server
   - This is BLOCKING all further workflow testing
   - Cannot proceed until MCP server can initialize

2. **Implement Issue #1 Fix** - API validation
   - Add pre-flight checks before calling n8n API
   - Validate workflow schema, node types, connections
   - Provide clear error messages

### High Priority (Next Session):
1. Test actual workflow creation via n8n API
2. Verify all 7 nodes work correctly
3. Test Teams webhook integration
4. Test Outlook email retrieval
5. Verify OpenAI analysis functionality

### Medium Priority (Phase 5.4):
1. Implement all Issue #1-3 fixes
2. Add comprehensive validation tools
3. Improve error messages and guidance
4. Add configuration templates

### Modified:
- ‚úÖ MCP_ISSUES_TRACKER.md (added Issue #2.5)
- ‚úÖ .n8n/database.sqlite (restored from backup)

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Action:
1. **DEBUG Issue #2.5**: Cache eviction logic is broken
   - Check `src/utils/cache-manager.ts` - `evict()` method
   - Verify memory limit calculation
   - Add console logging to debug cache state

2. **Test MCP Server Independently**:
   - Start with empty database
   - Test with minimal node set
   - Confirm cache works without memory pressure

### For Next Workflow Building Session:
1. Ensure MCP server starts cleanly
2. Use n8n API directly to create workflow (bypass MCP if needed)
3. Test each node type individually
4. Verify Teams and Outlook credentials configured
5. Perform end-to-end execution test
