# Phase 5: Agentic GraphRAG Architecture for n8n Agents

**Purpose:** Design the BEST Agentic Graph RAG specifically optimized for n8n workflow agents
**Status:** Architecture Definition + Phase 5.1 Complete
**Target:** Production-ready by Day 18 (Early February 2025)

---

## üéØ WHAT MAKES THIS AN AGENTIC GRAPHRAG?

### Key Difference from Traditional RAG

**Traditional RAG:**
- Simple vector similarity search
- Returns documents/chunks
- No understanding of relationships
- No agent reasoning support

**Agentic GraphRAG (This Project):**
- Graph-based semantic understanding
- Understands n8n node relationships
- Supports agent reasoning and planning
- Designed for multi-agent orchestration
- Provides explanations, not just results

---

## üèóÔ∏è AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Agent-Centric Design
The GraphRAG must be designed FROM THE AGENT'S PERSPECTIVE:

```
AI Agent (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
    ‚Üì
"I need to send Slack notifications"
    ‚Üì
GraphRAG (Agentic)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Understands agent's intent
    ‚îú‚îÄ Provides reasoning chain
    ‚îú‚îÄ Suggests 5 nodes + WHY
    ‚îú‚îÄ Explains relationships
    ‚îî‚îÄ Recommends workflow pattern
    ‚Üì
Agent gets reasoning, not just results
```

### Principle 2: Query-as-Reasoning
Each query should be treated as an agent reasoning step:

```
Query: "How do I get data from an API and send it to Slack?"

Agent's reasoning steps:
1. Need to: Fetch (HTTP Request)
2. Transform (Set, Map Over Items)
3. Send (Slack)

GraphRAG provides:
- Step 1: HTTPRequest node + why
- Step 2: Set/Map nodes + when to use
- Step 3: Slack node + configuration
- Complete workflow pattern
```

### Principle 3: Explainability
Every response must explain WHY, not just WHAT:

```
Response should include:
‚úì Node recommendation (WHAT)
‚úì Reasoning for choice (WHY)
‚úì Related nodes (CONTEXT)
‚úì Workflow patterns (HOW)
‚úì Confidence score (CERTAINTY)
‚úì Alternatives (OPTIONS)
```

### Principle 4: Graph Traversal as Agent Planning
Use graph traversal to generate agent plans:

```
Agent query: "Monitor API and alert team"

GraphRAG traversal:
1. Find primary node: HTTPRequest
2. Explore relationships:
   - compatible_with: Switch, Set
   - used_in_pattern: API Monitoring
   - solves: Health Check Use Case
3. Generate plan:
   - Trigger ‚Üí HTTPRequest ‚Üí Switch ‚Üí Slack/Teams
4. Suggest improvements
5. Validate structure
```

## üîë AGENTIC FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

### Feature 1: Multi-Turn Agent Memory Integration
GraphRAG must remember agent conversation context:

```python
# Agent Memory Integration
class AgentAwareGraphRAG:
    def __init__(self, shared_memory):
        self.shared_memory = shared_memory  # Link to agent shared memory
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.agent_context = {}

    async def query_for_agent(self, agent_id, query, context):
        # Store in shared memory for other agents
        # Retrieve previous agent queries
        # Use context for better recommendations
        pass
```

### Feature 2: Reasoning Chain Generation
Generate step-by-step reasoning:

```python
class ReasoningChain:
    """Generate reasoning steps for agent decision-making"""

    async def generate_workflow_plan(self, goal):
        """
        Example output:
        {
            "goal": "Send daily reports to Slack",
            "reasoning": [
                "Step 1: Schedule trigger (Schedule node)",
                "Step 2: Fetch report data (Database/HTTP)",
                "Step 3: Format data (Set, Template)",
                "Step 4: Send to Slack (Slack node)",
            ],
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "alternative_paths": [...]
        }
        """
        pass
```

### Feature 3: Agent Confidence Scoring
Score recommendations for agent trust:

```python
class ConfidenceScorer:
    """Score agent recommendations for confidence"""

    def score_recommendation(self, recommendation):
        """
        Factors:
        - Semantic similarity: 0.98
        - Pattern match: 0.95
        - Success rate: 0.98
        - Community usage: 0.92

        Final: 0.96 (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
        """
        pass
```

### Feature 4: Agent Task Decomposition
Break complex goals into agent tasks:

```python
class TaskDecomposer:
    """Decompose agent goals into subtasks"""

    async def decompose(self, goal):
        """
        Input: "Sync data between 3 systems every hour"

        Output:
        - Task 1: Setup schedule trigger
        - Task 2: Fetch from system A
        - Task 3: Transform data
        - Task 4: Push to system B
        - Task 5: Push to system C
        - Task 6: Log results
        """
        pass
```

### Feature 5: Agent Learning & Feedback Loop
Learn from agent usage:

```python
class AgentLearningLoop:
    """Learn from how agents use GraphRAG"""

    async def record_agent_decision(self,
        agent_id, query, recommendation,
        accepted, feedback):
        """
        Store: Which recommendations agents accept
        Track: Success/failure patterns
        Improve: Future recommendations for similar agents
        """
        pass
```
