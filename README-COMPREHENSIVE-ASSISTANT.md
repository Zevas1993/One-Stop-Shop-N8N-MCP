## 🎓 Examples

### **Example 1: Perfect Style Matching**

**Original Email from Client:**
> "Hi! Quick question - are we still on track for the Q4 deadline?"

**AI-Generated Response (matching your style):**

>
> I'll have the team send you the latest status report by EOD tomorrow so you have all the details.
>
> Let me know if you need anything else!
>
> Best,
> [Your name]"

**Context Used:**
- Your typical greeting with Sarah ("Hey Sarah!")
