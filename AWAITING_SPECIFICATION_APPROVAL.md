## üìã WHAT HAS BEEN CREATED

I have created a **comprehensive GraphRAG specification** that defines EXACTLY what the system needs to be:

### Document: [GRAPHRAG_COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md](GRAPHRAG_COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md)

**Contains:**

1. **Core Requirements** (Section üéØ)
   - What GraphRAG is for
   - What problems it solves
   - What it enables

2. **Data Model** (Section üìä)
   - Entity types (526 n8n nodes + patterns + use cases)
   - Relationship types (7 types of connections)
   - Metadata attributes (rich node information)

3. **Query & Search** (Section üîç)
   - 5 types of queries it must answer
   - Exact examples with expected outputs
   - Semantic understanding approach

4. **Embeddings & Semantics** (Section üß†)
   - Embedding model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim)
   - Similarity computation
   - Scoring and ranking

5. **Storage & Performance** (Section üíæ)
   - Database schema
   - Size: ~900MB
   - Query latency: <50ms P95
   - Throughput: >100 queries/second

6. **Data Flow** (Section üîÑ)
   - Initial graph build process (7 steps)
   - Incremental update process
   - Exactly what happens at each step

7. **Query Execution** (Section ‚öôÔ∏è)
   - Step-by-step walkthrough of a query
   - Ranking algorithm
   - Response format

8. **Integration Points** (Section üîå)
   - How it integrates with existing n8n-mcp
   - New MCP tools it enables
   - Enhanced workflow

9. **Success Criteria** (Section ‚úÖ)
   - 7 categories of success metrics
   - Clear yes/no checkpoints

## ‚ùì BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION: PLEASE CONFIRM

### Question 1: Data Scope
**Current Spec:** Extract ALL 526 n8n nodes into graph

**Alternatives:**
- A) Extract all 526 nodes ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- B) Extract subset (e.g., top 100 most used)

**Current Spec:** Sentence-Transformers "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" (384-dim)

**Should we use:**

- B) OpenAI embeddings (requires API)
- C) Local Ollama embeddings

### Question 5: LLM Integration
**Current Spec:** Optional Ollama for local LLM (not required for core functionality)

**Should we:**
- A) Include Ollama integration ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- B) Skip LLM, use embeddings only
- C) Require cloud LLM (OpenAI, etc.)
- D) Something different

### Question 6: Auto-Updates
**Current Spec:** Watch for n8n node changes and update graph incrementally

**Should we:**
- A) Implement auto-update ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- B) Require manual updates only
- C) Schedule periodic updates (every 6 hours)
- D) Something different

### Question 7: Performance Targets
**Current Spec:**
- Query latency: <50ms P95
- Throughput: >100 queries/second
- Database size: <1GB
- Accuracy: >85% for common queries

**Should we:**
- A) Use these targets ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- B) Adjust targets (which ones?)
- C) Add additional performance metrics

### Question 8: Scope of Implementation
**Current Spec:** Full complete implementation with zero stubs

**Should we:**
- A) Implement everything fully ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- B) Implement in phases (Phase 5.1, 5.2, etc.)
- C) Something different

## üìù CHECKLIST FOR APPROVAL

Before we begin implementation, please confirm:

- [ ] **Data Model**: The entity and relationship types are correct
- [ ] **Query Types**: We understand what queries need to be answered
- [ ] **Performance**: The latency and throughput targets are acceptable
- [ ] **Integration**: How it should integrate with existing n8n-mcp is clear
- [ ] **Embeddings**: The embedding model choice (Sentence-Transformers) is approved
- [ ] **LLM**: We should/shouldn't use Ollama (confirm choice)
- [ ] **Auto-Updates**: Should/shouldn't implement incremental updates
- [ ] **Use Cases**: The ~50 use case entities are appropriate
- [ ] **No Stubs**: You want FULL implementation, not skeleton code
