   - **COMPLETED:** Added integration examples for PatternAgent and ValidatorAgent

4. ✅ Update Week 2 (Auto-updater) section

8. ✅ Add n8n Workflow Patterns appendix
   - Modular design patterns
   - Error handling patterns
   - Supervisor pattern
   - 2-3 concrete examples
   - **COMPLETED:** Appendix A added with 7 patterns, 5 anti-patterns, integration examples (345 lines)

   - Zero-copy approach
   - Code examples
   - **COMPLETED:** Appendix B added with complete architecture, 4 optimization strategies, performance table (242 lines)

10. ✅ Emphasize cache-first architecture throughout
    - Local cache authoritative
    - Offline operation capability
    - Management tools conditional on API
    - **COMPLETED:** Updated architecture diagrams and descriptions throughout

**IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Status: ✅ 100% COMPLETE**

**Summary:**
- Original: 1,870 lines
- Current: 4,175 lines (+2,305 lines, +123% growth)
- All 10 major enhancements completed
- 2 comprehensive appendices added (587 lines)
- Ready for Codex to begin code implementation

---

**Priority 2: Complete GRAPHRAG_SPEC_WIP.md (0% Complete - Ready to Start)**

1. ❌ Fix tool count throughout (58 MVP, 62 Phase 2)
2. ❌ Add "Performance Baselines" section
3. ❌ Add "MVP vs Phase 2 Feature Split" section
4. ❌ Update Technology Stack table
5. ❌ Clarify database/cache locations
6. ❌ Add integration specifications
7. ❌ Update file/code estimates
8. ❌ Add n8n workflow best practices
9. ❌ Document existing code reuse
10. ❌ Add Week 0 POC requirements
11-29. ❌ Additional consistency updates (19 more enhancements)

**Priority 3: Final Consistency Pass**

1. ❌ Verify tool counts match (58 MVP, 62 Phase 2) in both docs
2. ❌ Ensure technology choices align
3. ❌ Confirm performance targets consistent
4. ❌ Check all internal links work
5. ❌ Remove any TODOs or placeholders

## Key Decisions Confirmed

From CLAUDE_TO_CODEX_RESPONSE.md (all 6 questions answered):

1. ✅ **Local cache authoritative:** %APPDATA%/n8n-mcp/graph/ is single source of truth
2. ✅ **Local embeddings:** sentence-transformers + nano-vectordb for MVP
3. ✅ **Cache location & polling:** %APPDATA%/n8n-mcp/graph/, 6-hour Python-based polling
4. ✅ **n8n HTTP client:** Enhance existing n8n-api-client.ts (not MCP server transport)
5. ✅ **MVP toolset:** Single query_graph tool (58 total: 57 + 1)
6. ✅ **Week numbering:** Add Week 0 content now, renumber globally on Day 3

## Coordination Notes

Codex has done excellent work adding the installer-first MVP framework and Before You Start section. My next steps are to:

1. Continue from where Codex left off (after line 223)
2. Add the missing major sections (Failure Modes, Cross-Platform)
3. Update individual week sections with integration details
4. Complete SPEC_WIP updates
5. Final consistency pass with Codex

---

**Status:** Ready to proceed with remaining documentation tasks.
**Blocker:** None
**ETA:** IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN 80% complete by end of Day 1
