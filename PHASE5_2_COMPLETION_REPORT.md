## 🧠 AGENTIC FEATURES BUILT IN

### 1. Agent Use Cases
Every node includes use cases agents care about:
```
Slack node use cases:
- Send notifications to team
- Alert on workflow errors
- Post daily reports
- Share metrics and dashboards
```

### 2. Agent Prerequisites
What agents need to know before using a node:
```
Slack prerequisites:
- Must authenticate with Slack workspace
- Need channel name or ID
- Understand message formatting
```

### 3. Agent Tips
Practical guidance from real usage:
```
Slack tips:
- Use blocks for rich formatting
- Set channel OR channel_id, not both
- Test with @channel first
- Slack has rate limits
```

### 4. Failure Modes
Common mistakes agents should avoid:
```
Slack common mistakes:
- Forgetting channel parameter
- Using wrong channel format
- Message too long
- Rate limited by Slack API
```

### 5. Common Configurations
Preset configurations agents can reuse:
```
Slack configurations:
- notification: {channel: "#alerts", text: "Alert from workflow"}
- report: {channel: "#reports", text: "Daily Report"}
```

### 6. Relationship Reasoning
Why nodes work together:
```
HTTP → Slack reasoning:
- Output: "JSON data from API"
- Input: "Slack expects: channel, text, blocks"
- Mapping: "API response becomes Slack message"
- Success rate: "95% of HTTP→Slack workflows work"
```

### 7. Success Rates
Real-world metrics:
```
Per node:
- Success rate: 0.98 (98% of workflows work)
- Usage frequency: 1250 (used in 1250 workflows)
- Average rating: 4.8 (agent satisfaction)
```

## 🔌 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING COMPONENTS

### Connection to Storage Layer (Phase 5.1)
```python
# Graph builder uses storage layer
db = Database("/path/to/graph.db")
builder = AgenticGraphBuilder(db)

# Stores data using storage models
storage_node = Node(
    id=agentic_node.id,
    label=agentic_node.label,
    metadata=agentic_node.metadata
)
db.add_node(storage_node)
```

### Connection to Multi-Agent System
```python
# Can notify orchestrator when graph is ready
await shared_memory.set('graph_building_status', 'complete')
await shared_memory.set('graph_ready', True)

# Agents can query graph statistics
graph_stats = db.get_stats()
```

### Connection to Query Engine (Phase 5.3)
```python
# Query engine will use this graph
embeddings = db.get_embedding(node_id)
edges = db.get_edges_from_node(node_id)
relationships = db.get_relationships(source, target)
```
